Python script for monitoring directory sizes and sending email alerts when thresholds are exceeded. Here's an overview of what the solution provides:

Key Features:

Directory Monitoring:
Recursively calculates the size of specified directories
Supports multiple directories with individual thresholds
Handles file access errors gracefully


Configurable Thresholds:
Accepts thresholds in various formats (bytes, KB, MB, GB, TB)
Easily configurable via INI file


Email Notifications:
Sends alerts to multiple recipients (comma-separated in config)
Configurable SMTP settings (host, port, credentials, TLS)
Detailed reports showing exceeded thresholds


Robust Error Handling:
Comprehensive try/except blocks
Detailed logging of operations and errors
Graceful failure management

pre-requisite: 
python should be installed in the target deployment VM/server/Machine
SMTP server details
Email distribution List
setup directory_monitor.ini file with Directory, Threshold, SMTP, and Email Distribution list

How to Use:

Run the Script
python directory_monitor.py
Or specify a custom config file:
python directory_monitor.py --config custom_config.ini

Schedule Regular Checks
Set up a cron job (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run the script at regular intervals

Implementation Notes:
The script calculates directory sizes recursively using os.walk
Email alerts include detailed information about exceeded thresholds
Size conversions handle various units (B, KB, MB, GB, TB)
Log files capture both successful operations and errors

This solution is designed to be reliable, maintainable, and adaptable to various environments. You can easily extend it with additional features like historical size tracking or more advanced alert conditions.
